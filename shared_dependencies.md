1. **Scrapy**: All the files share the dependency on the Scrapy library, which is used for web scraping in Python. This includes functions, classes, and methods provided by Scrapy.

2. **Reddit Data Schema**: The "items.py" file will define the data schema for the Reddit data that will be scraped. This schema will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py" to know what data to extract and by "pipelines.py" to process and store the data.

3. **Scrapy Settings**: The "settings.py" file will contain settings for the Scrapy spider, such as the user agent, download delay, and whether to follow robots.txt rules. These settings will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" and "reddit_spider.py".

4. **Scrapy Spider**: The "reddit_spider.py" file will define the Scrapy spider for scraping Reddit. This will include the name of the spider, the start URLs, and the parsing method. The spider name will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" to start the spider.

5. **Scrapy Items**: The "items.py" file will define the Scrapy Item class for storing scraped data. This class will be used by "reddit_spider.py" to store the scraped data and by "pipelines.py" to process and store the data.

6. **Scrapy Pipelines**: The "pipelines.py" file will define the Scrapy pipeline for processing and storing scraped data. This will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" to process and store the data.

7. **JSON Output**: The "output.json" file will be used by "pipelines.py" to store the scraped data in a structured format. The file name will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" to specify where to store the data.

8. **DOM Elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped from Reddit will be defined in "reddit_spider.py". These will include the id names of the DOM elements that the spider will extract data from.

9. **Pagination and Dynamic Content Handling**: The methods for handling pagination and dynamic content on Reddit will be defined in "reddit_spider.py". These methods will be used by "reddit_scraper.py" to navigate through Reddit pages and handle dynamic content.
